# Data-Challenge-


The goal of this challenge for SNCF-Transilien is to explore the possibility of predicting the short-term occupancy rate on board trains in real-time. This would allow providing a real-time information service about the onboard load to its travelers through its digital media.

When a traveler is waiting for train k at station s, the train may be several stations upstream; however, we wish to provide the traveler with the most coherent crowd information possible with their experience at the moment they board the train. To do this, we must predict for each train the actual occupancy rates at the next stations. Here, we propose to predict, more simply, the occupancy rate at the next station only.
